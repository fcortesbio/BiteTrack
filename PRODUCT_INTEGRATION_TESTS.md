# Product Integration Tests - Task List

This document outlines all the integration tests that need to be implemented for the Product management endpoints in `tests/integration/products.test.js`.

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETED:**
- POST /bitetrack/products - Basic creation with valid data
- POST /bitetrack/products - Creation with minimum required fields  
- POST /bitetrack/products - Validation error handling

## Endpoints to Test

Based on the routes defined in `routes/products.js`, we have the following endpoints:
- `GET /bitetrack/products` - List products
- `POST /bitetrack/products` - Create product (âœ… COMPLETED)
- `PATCH /bitetrack/products/:id` - Update product
- `DELETE /bitetrack/products/:id` - Delete product

## Testing Best Practices to Follow

### âœ… **Test Structure**
- Use clear `Arrange â†’ Act â†’ Assert` pattern
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### âœ… **Data Management**
- Clean database between tests (already handled by `afterEach`)
- Create test data programmatically using `testUtils` helpers
- Use realistic but deterministic test data

### âœ… **Assertions**
- Verify HTTP status codes
- Check response body structure and content
- Validate database state when necessary
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

### âœ… **Error Testing**
- Test all validation rules from `utils/validation.js`
- Verify error message format and content
- Test authentication and authorization scenarios

### âœ… **Coverage Goals**
- Aim for 100% line coverage on Product controller
- Test all validation rules
- Cover all error conditions
- Test authentication on all endpoints

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test Data**: Use `testUtils.createTestProduct()` and similar helpers for consistent test data
2. **Authentication**: All endpoints require authentication - test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
3. **Validation**: Reference `utils/validation.js` for exact validation rules to test
4. **Database**: Tests use MongoDB Memory Server - database is isolated and cleaned between tests
5. **Async/Await**: All tests should be async and properly handle promises
6. **Error Format**: API returns errors in format: `{ error, message, statusCode, details? }`

## Estimated Timeline
- **GET /products**: 1-2 days
- **PATCH /products/:id**: 2-3 days  
- **DELETE /products/:id**: 1-2 days
- **Additional edge cases**: 1 day
- **Integration tests**: 1 day

**Total: 6-9 days** depending on thoroughness and any issues encountered.

*Remember to run `npm run test -- tests/integration/products.test.js` frequently to ensure tests are passing as you implement them!*
