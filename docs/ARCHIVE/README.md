# 📦 BiteTrack Documentation Archive

This directory contains **historical and completed documentation** that provides valuable context about the project's development journey, but is no longer part of the active documentation.

## 📂 Directory Structure

### 📋 `planning/`

**Completed planning documents and strategic decisions**

- **ESM-MIGRATION-ROADMAP.md** - Detailed plan for CommonJS → ES Modules migration (✅ Completed Nov 2025)
- **MIGRATION-ROADMAP.md** - Strategic modernization plan including ES Modules and MCP/AI integration
- **NEW-STRATEGY-SUMMARY.md** - Executive decision to modernize backend before UX development (Oct 2025)
- **DAILY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** - Project health snapshot from October 6, 2025

**Why archived:** These documents were planning/strategy docs for work that has been completed or superseded by current roadmap.

### 📊 `status-snapshots/`

**Point-in-time project status reports**

- **PROJECT-STATUS.md** - Comprehensive status report from November 4, 2025
- **DOCUMENTATION-UPDATE-SUMMARY.md** - Documentation audit results from November 4, 2025

**Why archived:** These are historical snapshots. Current status is always in README.md and ROADMAP.md.

### 🔧 `implementation-details/`

**Feature implementation specifications and analysis**

- **PASSWORD_RESET_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Password reset feature technical spec
- **REQUEST_RECOVERY_ENDPOINT.md** - Password recovery endpoint implementation

## 🎯 Purpose of This Archive

1. **Historical Context** - Understand the "why" behind architectural decisions
2. **Learning Resource** - Reference implementation approaches for similar features
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete record of development process and decisions
4. **Knowledge Preservation** - Retain valuable technical analysis and research

## 📚 Current Documentation

For up-to-date project information, refer to:

- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Complete setup guide and feature overview
- **[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md)** - Strategic development roadmap and priorities

## 🔍 When to Use Archive Documents

**Use archived docs when you need to:**

- Understand why a particular architectural decision was made
- Reference implementation patterns from completed features
- Review historical project milestones and evolution
- Find detailed technical specifications for existing features

**Don't use archived docs for:**
