# Jujutsu (jj) Learning Guide üöÄ

Welcome to your hands-on jj learning journey! This guide will take you from zero to confident jj user.

## üéØ What Makes jj Different?

**Git thinking**: Working Directory ‚Üí Stage ‚Üí Commit  
**jj thinking**: You're always "inside" a change, editing it directly

## üìã Prerequisites Check

Make sure jj is working:
```bash
jj --version  # Should show version 0.33.0
jj status     # Should show current state
```

---

## üö∂ **PART 1: Basic Concepts (15 minutes)**

### Exercise 1: Understanding Your Current State

```bash
# Check where you are
jj status

# Look at recent history
jj log --limit 5

# The @ symbol shows your current "working copy" (the change you're editing)
# The change ID (like xlzpsnvp) never changes, even when you edit the change
# The hash (like 2b48aac9) changes every time the content changes
```

**ü§î Try this**: Run `jj status` a few times. Notice it always tells you exactly where you are.

### Exercise 2: Making Your First Change

```bash
# Create a simple test file
echo "Hello from jj!" > jj-test.txt

# Check status immediately 
jj status
# Notice: jj automatically tracked the file! No 'git add' needed.

# Add a description to your change
jj describe -m "feat: add my first jj test file"

# Check the log
jj log --limit 3
```

**üéØ Key insight**: In jj, you're always working "inside" a change. Files are tracked automatically.

### Exercise 3: Creating a New Change (Stacking)

```bash
# Create a new change on top of the current one
jj new -m "feat: improve test file"

# Check your position
jj status
jj log --limit 4

# Add content to the existing file
echo "This is an improvement!" >> jj-test.txt

# See how jj tracked it automatically
jj status
```

**üéØ Key insight**: `jj new` creates a new change stacked on top of the current one.

---

## üèÉ **PART 2: Navigation & Editing (20 minutes)**

### Exercise 4: Moving Between Changes

```bash
# See your current stack
jj log --limit 5

# Go back to edit the first change (use the change ID from your log)
# Replace 'xlzpsnvp' with your actual change ID from jj log
jj edit xlzpsnvp

# Check where you are now
jj status

# Modify the original file
echo "Edited the original!" >> jj-test.txt

# See what happened
jj status

# Go back to the top change
jj edit @+  # @+ means "one change after current"
```

**üéØ Key insight**: You can edit ANY change in your stack. jj handles the complexity.

### Exercise 5: Understanding the Magic of Rebasing

```bash
# You should be on your second change now
jj status

# Look at the content of your test file
cat jj-test.txt

# Notice it has BOTH changes! jj automatically "rebased" when you edited the first change.
```

**ü§Ø Mind = Blown**: jj automatically maintained your stack when you edited the middle change!

### Exercise 6: Creating Parallel Changes

```bash
# Go back to your first change
jj edit xlzpsnvp  # (use your actual change ID)

# Create a NEW change that branches off from here
jj new -m "feat: add different feature"

# Create a different file
echo "Parallel development!" > parallel.txt

# See your tree structure
jj log --limit 6

# Notice you have parallel development now!
```

---

## üé® **PART 3: Bookmarks (Branches) (10 minutes)**

### Exercise 7: Using Bookmarks

```bash
# Create a bookmark (like a Git branch) on your current change
jj bookmark create my-feature

# See all bookmarks
jj bookmark list

# Check the log - notice the bookmark appears
jj log --limit 5

# Go to a different change
jj edit xlzpsnvp  # (your first change)

# Create another bookmark
jj bookmark create foundation

# See how bookmarks help you navigate
jj log --limit 6
```

### Exercise 8: Switching Between Bookmarks

```bash
# Go to your feature bookmark
jj edit my-feature

# Check where you are
jj status

# Go to foundation
jj edit foundation

# Check again
jj status
```

**üéØ Key insight**: Bookmarks are just friendly names for changes. You can have many of them.

---

## üîß **PART 4: Practical Workflow (15 minutes)**

### Exercise 9: A Real Development Workflow

Let's simulate adding a new API endpoint:

```bash
# Start from main
jj edit main

# Create a new feature
jj new -m "feat: add user profile endpoint"

# Create the "code"
mkdir -p api
echo "function getUserProfile() { return user; }" > api/profile.js

# Stack the tests on top
jj new -m "test: add profile endpoint tests"

# Create the "tests"
mkdir -p tests
echo "test('profile endpoint works', () => { ... })" > tests/profile.test.js

# Stack documentation
jj new -m "docs: document profile endpoint"

echo "# Profile API\n\nGET /api/profile - returns user profile" > api/README.md

# See your beautiful stack
jj log --limit 5
```

### Exercise 10: Editing in the Middle of a Stack

```bash
# Oops! Need to fix something in the original endpoint
jj edit @--  # Go back 2 changes (to the endpoint)

# "Fix a bug"
echo "// Fixed: added error handling" >> api/profile.js

# Go back to the top
jj edit @++  # Forward 2 changes

# Check that your fix is in the final result
cat api/profile.js
```

**ü§Ø Magic Alert**: Your fix automatically propagated through the entire stack!

---

## üåâ **PART 5: Git Integration (10 minutes)**

### Exercise 11: Working with Git

```bash
# See what Git thinks
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Export your jj changes to Git
jj git export

# Check Git again
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### Exercise 12: Creating a Git Branch

```bash
# Create a bookmark for Git integration
jj bookmark create feature/user-profile

# Export to Git
jj git export

# Check Git branches
git branch -a

# You can now push to Git normally!
```

---

## üéì **PART 6: Essential Commands Reference**

### Daily Commands
```bash
# Check status
jj status

# View history
jj log
jj log --limit 10

# Create new change
jj new -m "description"

# Add description to current change
jj describe -m "description"

# Navigate
jj edit <change-id>
jj edit @+    # Next change
jj edit @-    # Previous change
jj edit main  # Go to main
```

### Bookmark Management
```bash
# Create bookmark
jj bookmark create <name>

# List bookmarks
jj bookmark list

# Go to bookmark
jj edit <bookmark-name>
```

### Git Integration
```bash
# Export changes to Git
jj git export

# Import changes from Git
jj git import
```

---

## üîÑ **PART 7: Zero-Double-Work Git Integration (15 minutes)**

**üéØ The Goal**: Eliminate the need for `git add` + `git commit` while still using Git remotes!

### The Problem: Double Work

Many new jj users fall into this pattern:
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - This is double work!
jj describe -m "my changes"     # jj tracks changes
git add .                       # manually stage for Git  
git commit -m "my changes"      # manually commit to Git
git push                        # push to remote
```

### The Solution: Seamless Integration

**‚úÖ CORRECT - Single workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Make changes (jj tracks automatically)
echo "new feature" > myfile.js

# 2. Describe your change
jj describe -m "feat: add new feature"

# 3. Push directly to Git in ONE step!
jj bookmark create feature/my-feature
jj git push --bookmark feature/my-feature --allow-new
```

### Exercise 13: Practice Zero-Double-Work Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new change
jj new -m "practice: testing zero-double-work"

# Step 2: Make some changes
echo "Testing jj Git integration!" > test-integration.md
echo "- No more git add" >> test-integration.md
echo "- No more git commit" >> test-integration.md
echo "- Direct push from jj!" >> test-integration.md

# Step 3: Check that jj tracked everything automatically
jj status
# You should see: A test-integration.md

# Step 4: Create bookmark and push in one workflow
jj bookmark create practice/zero-double-work
jj git push --bookmark practice/zero-double-work --allow-new
```

### Exercise 14: Alternative Sync Workflow

If you prefer working with existing Git branches:

```bash
# Method 1: Export then push
jj describe -m "feat: another feature"
jj git export              # Sync jj changes to Git
git push origin main       # Use regular Git push

# Method 2: Track existing Git branch
jj bookmark track main@origin   # Track remote branch
jj git push                      # Push to tracked branch
```

### Exercise 15: Handle Git Pull Requests

```bash
# When someone else pushes changes:
git fetch                  # Get latest from remote
jj git import             # Import Git changes to jj

# When you want to sync your work:
jj git push --all         # Push all your bookmarks
```

### üéØ Key Git Integration Commands

```bash
# Core workflow - no double work
jj describe -m "message"                    # Describe changes
jj bookmark create feature/name             # Create feature bookmark
jj git push --bookmark feature/name --allow-new  # Push to Git

# Sync with existing Git workflows  
jj git export                               # Export jj ‚Üí Git
jj git import                               # Import Git ‚Üí jj
jj bookmark track branch@origin            # Track remote branch
jj git push                                 # Push tracked bookmarks

# Handle remotes
jj git fetch                                # Fetch from Git remotes
jj git push --all                           # Push all bookmarks
```

### üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

```bash
# ‚ùå DON'T do this (double work):
jj describe -m "message"
git add .
git commit -m "message"    # Redundant!

# ‚ùå DON'T do this (out of sync):
git commit -m "message"    # jj doesn't know about this
# Now jj and Git are out of sync!

# ‚úÖ DO this instead:
jj describe -m "message"   # jj handles everything
jj git push --bookmark name --allow-new
```

### üí° Pro Tips for Git Integration

1. **Work in colocated repos** - Have both `.git` and `.jj` directories
2. **Use bookmarks for branches** - `jj bookmark create` instead of `git checkout -b`
3. **Push from jj directly** - `jj git push` instead of `git push`
4. **Let jj handle staging** - Never use `git add` in a jj workflow
5. **Sync when collaborating** - Use `jj git import` after `git fetch`

**üéâ Result**: You now have a single, streamlined workflow that works with both jj's power and Git's ecosystem!

## üöÄ **Your First Real Project Workflow**

Now try this with actual development:

1. **Start a feature**:
   ```bash
   jj edit main
   jj new -m "feat: implement user authentication"
   ```

2. **Build incrementally**:
   ```bash
   # Add model
   touch models/user.js
   jj new -m "feat: add user controller"
   
   # Add controller  
   touch controllers/auth.js
   jj new -m "feat: add auth routes"
   
   # Add routes
   touch routes/auth.js
   ```

3. **Edit and refine**:
   ```bash
   # Go back and improve the model
   jj edit @--
   # Make changes...
   
   # Go back to tip
   jj edit @++
   ```

4. **Prepare for Git**:
   ```bash
   jj bookmark create feature/user-auth
   jj git export
   ```

---

## üéØ **Key Mental Model Shifts**

1. **No staging area** - Changes are tracked automatically
2. **You're always "in" a change** - Not in a working directory
3. **Change IDs are permanent** - Even when you edit the change
4. **Stacking is natural** - Build features incrementally
5. **History editing is safe** - jj handles the complexity
6. **Conflicts don't block work** - They're resolved when needed

---

## üÜò **When Things Go Wrong**

```bash
# See everything
jj log --limit 20

# If lost, go back to known state
jj edit main

# Check Git state
git status

# Start over from Git
jj git import
```

---

## üèÜ **Graduation Exercise**

Create a complete feature with jj:
1. Start from main
2. Create 3-4 stacked changes for different parts
3. Edit a middle change
4. Create a bookmark
5. Export to Git
6. Verify everything works

**You've got this!** üåü
