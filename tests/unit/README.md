# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for individual components:

## Structure
- `controllers/` - Tests for controller functions
- `models/` - Tests for Mongoose models and schemas
- `middleware/` - Tests for authentication, authorization, and validation middleware
- `utils/` - Tests for utility functions

## TODO: Implementation
Each subdirectory will contain focused unit tests that test individual functions and components in isolation, separate from the full API integration tests.
